# cbm2-clock
PETSCII Clock Program for Commodore CBM-II computers

I wrote this as a fun exercise to learn how the banking scheme works on the MOS6509. It does nothing more than display a PETSCII graphics clock on the display.

There's a build.sh shell script that will assemble everything and create a d80 file so you can run it on a cbm-ii emulator from a d80 disk image. It requires 64tass to assemble it.
